# aMail — Agentic Mail

aMail is a self-hosted mail client that holds all of your inboxes in one place and gives your agents a single, authenticated point of connection to every one of them.

It is **agentic first**: alongside the human read/unread state, every message carries an **analyzed / not yet analyzed** flag that agents set as they process mail. Ask for `is:unanalyzed`, do the work, mark it analyzed, and nothing gets handled twice — by an agent or by you.

aMail is the open-source continuation of GigaMail and upgrades existing GigaMail installations in place.

> aMail is an independent project. It is not affiliated with Google, Gmail, Apple, or Microsoft.

## What it does

- **Unified inbox** for any number of IMAP/SMTP accounts: Gmail, iCloud, Outlook, Mail-in-a-Box, or any custom server. Threading from `Message-ID`/`References` with a safe subject fallback.
- **One endpoint for agents.** A Streamable HTTP [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server at `/mcp` plus a REST API at `/api`, both gated by the same access token. Cursor, Claude, or anything that speaks HTTP can list, search, read, reply, triage, and manage accounts.
- **Analyzed flags.** `analyzedAt`/`analyzedBy` per message, `unanalyzedCount` per conversation, `is:analyzed`/`is:unanalyzed` search operators, a "Not yet analyzed" queue in the sidebar, and `message_action: analyzed` for agents. Local-only; never written back to IMAP.
- **Explainable smart views.** Deterministic, on-device classification into Primary, GitHub CI, Logs, Status updates, and Ops errors, each with a human-readable reason. Routine infrastructure digests from sources you configure stay out of the default inbox unless they report a failure.
- **Flagged people.** Turn any set of addresses into a sidebar folder. Edit in Settings, or let an agent manage the list with `list_flags`/`set_flags`.
- **First-run wizard.** Connect inboxes, get agent config snippets, and learn the analyzed flow in four steps.
- **Private by default.** Remote content is blocked until you ask; when loaded, it is fetched server-side through an optional Tor/Privoxy relay, never by the browser. Known tracking pixels stay blocked. HTML is sanitized; SSRF targets are rejected.
- **Secure by default.** Credentials encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM), access-token gate, passkey (WebAuthn) unlock, read-only non-root container bound to loopback.
- **A real mail client.** Compose with a visual HTML editor, recipient chips, attachments, per-account signatures and identities, Gmail-style shortcuts, right-click context menus on conversations, messages, drafts, and accounts, FTS5 search with operators, snooze, star, archive.

## Quick start (Docker)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<you>/amail.git && cd amail
cp .env.example .env
openssl rand -hex 32   # paste as AMAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY
openssl rand -hex 32   # paste as AMAIL_ACCESS_TOKEN
sh deploy/launch.sh    # builds and starts aMail + the Tor relay, loopback-only
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3080` (through an SSH tunnel if the server is remote), unlock with the access token, and the setup wizard takes it from there. See [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md) for reverse proxies, passkey origins, backups, and upgrades.

## Quick start (local development)

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env    # set the two secrets; AMAIL_COOKIE_SECURE=false for plain http
npm run dev             # Vite on :5173, API on :3000
```

## Connecting an agent

Every connected inbox is reachable through one MCP endpoint. Authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer <AMAIL_ACCESS_TOKEN>` (or the browser session cookie).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "amail": {
      "url": "https://mail.example.com/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${env:AMAIL_ACCESS_TOKEN}" }
    }
  }
}
```

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `list_accounts`, `list_providers` | Connected accounts and provider presets |
| `list_messages` | List/search conversations. `q` honours `from:`, `to:`, `subject:`, `has:attachment`, `after:`/`before:`, `is:unread`, `is:starred`, `is:unanalyzed`, `is:analyzed`, `in:` |
| `get_message`, `get_thread` | Read one message or a whole thread |
| `send_message` | Compose and send via the account's SMTP |
| `message_action` | `read`/`unread`, `star`/`unstar`, `archive`, `trash`, `spam`, `snooze`, **`analyzed`/`unanalyzed`** (with `by: "<agent name>"`) |
| `list_flags`, `set_flags` | Read or replace the flagged-people list |
| `sync_mail`, `test_account`, `add_account`, `update_account`, `delete_account` | Account lifecycle; credentials are accepted but never echoed |

The recommended agent loop:

1. `list_messages { q: "is:unanalyzed" }`
2. `get_thread` for anything that needs context; act (`send_message`, `message_action`, …)
3. `message_action { action: "analyzed", by: "triage-agent" }`

The same operations exist over REST (`GET /api/messages?q=is%3Aunanalyzed`, `POST /api/messages/:id/analyzed`, `GET/PUT /api/flags`).

## Configuration

All settings are environment variables; see [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full annotated list. Every `AMAIL_*` variable also accepts the GigaMail-era `GIGAMAIL_*` name.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AMAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | **Required.** Encrypts stored IMAP/SMTP credentials |
| `AMAIL_ACCESS_TOKEN` | **Required.** Gates the UI, REST API, and MCP endpoint |
| `AMAIL_BIND_ADDRESS`, `AMAIL_PORT` | Where Compose publishes the app (default `127.0.0.1:3080`) |
| `AMAIL_RP_ID`, `AMAIL_ORIGIN` | Public hostname/origin for passkeys behind a reverse proxy |
| `AMAIL_OPS_SOURCES` | Comma-separated keywords for your infrastructure digests (default `proxmox,watchtower`; empty disables) |
| `AMAIL_TRUST_PROXY`, `AMAIL_COOKIE_SECURE` | Reverse-proxy and cookie hardening |
| `AMAIL_SYNC_*`, `SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | Initial window, timeouts, size caps, background polling |
| `REMOTE_CONTENT_PROXY_URL` | Set by `deploy/launch.sh` to route remote images via Tor/Privoxy |

Person flags are stored in the database, not the environment: manage them in **Settings → Flagged people** or via `PUT /api/flags`.

## Upgrading from GigaMail

Nothing to migrate. A GigaMail `.env` works unchanged, an existing `gigamail.sqlite` is opened in place, the old session cookie stays valid, and browser storage keys fall back automatically. Point the `amail-data` volume at your existing named volume (commented example in `docker-compose.yml`) or keep your old `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`. Details in [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md#upgrading-from-gigamail).

## Account notes

- **Gmail / Google Workspace:** full address plus a Google app password (requires 2-Step Verification).
- **iCloud Mail:** Apple app-specific password; aMail uses the mailbox name for IMAP and the full address for SMTP.
- **Mail-in-a-Box:** the public `box.` hostname from the TLS certificate (never the LAN IP), IMAPS 993, SMTP 587 with STARTTLS.
- **Outlook / Microsoft 365:** app password; aMail does not use Microsoft OAuth.
- **Custom:** separate IMAP/SMTP hosts and ports; non-implicit-TLS connections require STARTTLS before authentication.

Connections are verified in memory before anything is saved. `GET /api/accounts/providers` and `POST /api/accounts/test` expose the same discovery and rate-limited check to agents.

## Search and smart views

Search uses SQLite FTS5 plus Gmail-style operators: `from:`, `to:`, `subject:`, `has:attachment`, `after:`/`before:YYYY-MM-DD`, `newer_than:7d`, `older_than:2w`, `is:unread`, `is:starred`, `is:unanalyzed`, `is:analyzed`, `in:sent`. Explicit searches also surface the quiet ops digests that the default inbox hides.

Smart classification runs locally and is versioned; when rules or `AMAIL_OPS_SOURCES` change, existing mail is reclassified on the next start. `GET /api/messages?category=github_ci` (or `primary`, `logs`, `status`, `ops_error`) filters by view and returns per-view counts.

## Privacy model

aMail never lets the browser fetch remote mail content. Approved images are proxied by the server — through Tor/Privoxy in the default launch mode — and known trackers stay blocked. URLs targeting loopback, private, link-local, multicast, and cloud-metadata ranges are rejected. Without the relay, remote content fails closed rather than using the host's direct connection. IMAP/SMTP traffic itself is not anonymised.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Press `?` for the cheatsheet: `j`/`k` move, `Enter` opens, `u` back, `e` archive, `#` trash, `r` reply, `s` star, `x` select, `/` search, `c` compose.

## Development

```sh
npm run dev      # UI + API with reload
npm test         # node:test server suite + vitest client suite
npm run check    # production build + syntax check
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs tests, the build, a dependency audit, Compose validation, both Docker builds, a live health check, and a boot with a GigaMail-era `.env`. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Status and license

aMail is a mail client, not a mail server: it connects to mailboxes you already have over IMAP/SMTP. It is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
